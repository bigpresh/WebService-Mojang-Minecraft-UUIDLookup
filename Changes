Revision history for WebService-Mojang-Minecraft-UUIDLookup

0.04    2017-03-14
        Quick bugfix for previous release, which didn't use Data::UUID properly.
0.03    2017-03-14
        Return formatted UUID too.
        (The UUID returned by Mojang has no hyphens; I was feeding it to some
        code looking for GP playerdata, which uses the full, hyphenated form.)

0.02    2014-04-15
        Removed POD tests from dist

0.01    2015-04-10
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
